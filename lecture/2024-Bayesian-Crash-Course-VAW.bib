  abstract = {The englacial and subglacial drainage systems exert key controls on glacier dynamics. However, due to their inaccessibility, they are still only poorly understood and more detailed observations are important, particularly to validate and tune physical models describing their dynamics. By creating artificial glacier moulins -- boreholes connected to the subglacial drainage system and supplied with water from surface streams -- we present a novel method to monitor the evolution of an englacial hydrological system with high temporal resolution. Here, we use artificial moulins as representations for vertical, pressurised, englacial R-channels. From tracer and pressure measurements, we derive time series of the hydraulic gradient, discharge, flow speed and channel cross-sectional area. Using these, we compute the Darcy--Weisbach friction factor, obtaining values which increase from 0.1 to 13 within five days of channel evolution. Furthermore, we simulate the growth of the cross-sectional area using different temperature gradients. The comparison to our measurements largely supports the common assumption that the temperature follows the pressure melting point. The deviations from this behaviour are analysed using various heat transfer parameterisations to assess their applicability. Finally, we discuss how artificial moulins could be combined with glacier-wide tracer experiments to constrain parameters of subglacial drainage more precisely.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimations of ice thickness and volume are indispensable for ice flow modelling, hydrological forecasts and sea-level rise projections. We present a new ice thickness estimation model based on a mass-conserving forward model and a Bayesian inversion scheme. The forward model calculates flux in an elevation-band flow-line model, and translates this into ice thickness and surface ice speed using a shallow ice formulation. Both ice thickness and speed are then extrapolated to the map plane. The model assimilates observations of ice thickness and speed using a Bayesian scheme implemented with a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, which calculates estimates of ice thickness and their error. We illustrate the model's capabilities by applying it to a mountain glacier, validate the model using 733 glaciers from four regions with ice thickness measurements, and demonstrate that the model can be used for large-scale studies by fitting it to over 30 000 glaciers from five regions. The results show that the model performs best when a few thickness observations are available; that the proposed scheme by which parameter-knowledge from a set of glaciers is transferred to others works but has room for improvements; and that the inferred regional ice volumes are consistent with recent estimates.},
