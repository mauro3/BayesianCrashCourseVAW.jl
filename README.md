[![Build Status](https://github.com/mauro3/BayesianCrashCourseVAW.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/mauro3/BayesianCrashCourseVAW.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)

This is a short workshop I gave at VAW on Bayesian inference.  Strucutre:

- 1h lecture with [slides](BayesianCrashCourseVAW-website/bayesian-crash-course-vaw.html)
- 1/2 day of hands-on

# Lecture

The lecture slides are here, compiled via Quarto from the files in `lecture/`.
# Hands-on

The hands on work is based around a super simple point glacier melt model as was used in the lecture part already.
